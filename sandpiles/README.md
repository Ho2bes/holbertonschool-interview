# Sandpiles

## Description
This project implements a function that computes the sum of two sandpiles. A sandpile is represented as a 3x3 grid, and a stable sandpile is one where no cell contains more than 3 grains of sand. The function will continue toppling unstable sandpiles until a stable state is reached.
