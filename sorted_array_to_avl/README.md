# Sorted Array to AVL

This project contains a function to convert a sorted array into an AVL (Adelson-Velsky and Landis) tree.

## Description

The program takes a sorted array of integers and constructs a balanced AVL tree. AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees, ensuring that the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node is at most 1.

## Files

- `sorted_array_to_avl.c`: Contains the implementation of the function to convert a sorted array to an AVL tree.
- `binary_tree.h`: Header file defining the structure of the binary tree and AVL tree nodes.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

Compile the program using `gcc` and include the necessary files. Use the function `sorted_array_to_avl` to create an AVL tree from a sorted array.
