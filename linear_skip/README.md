# Linear Skip

This project implements a `linear_skip` function, which searches for a value in a sorted skip list.

## Description

A skip list is a data structure that allows fast search within an ordered sequence of elements. The `linear_skip` function performs a search in a skip list by leveraging the express lane for faster traversal, followed by a linear search in the appropriate block.
