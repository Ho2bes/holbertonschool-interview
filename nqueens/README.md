# N-Queens Problem Solver

## Description
The `0-nqueens.py` script is a Python program that solves the N-Queens problem. The N-Queens problem is a classic combinatorial problem where the goal is to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Usage
The script takes a single command-line argument, `N`, which represents the size of the chessboard and the number of queens to place.
